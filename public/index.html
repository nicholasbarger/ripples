    <h1>Welcome to ripples</h1>
    <p>The point of this project is to allow all developers from around the world to work
    together to create amazing code and processes.  I want to see developers in every
    language be able to work together and build on top of each others work.</p>
    <p>I want all of the plumbing code to be minimized and more time spent on the value
    added by each contribution so it solves real world problems.</p>
